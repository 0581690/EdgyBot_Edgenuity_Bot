# EdgyBot - Edgenuity Bot 🤖
<h3>Brief Intro: </h3>
I have tested this script on 10+ accounts. Each of them had around 2-4 classes that EdgyBot completed succesfully. They were all satisfied with the results. The more people I tested it on the better I was able to make it. I added extra features such as but not limited to, a fail-safe AFK sort of system in order to allow EdgyBot to continue doing work no matter what issues it faces. 😊
<h3>Description ( Ik it's long 💀) </h3>
EdgyBot: A partially AFK Edgenuity Bot that works on 99% of assignments offered by Edgenuity. It does all non test/quizzes on course-line first (By itself) and leaves the rest for the user. For tests, pre-tests, quizzes, cumulative-exams, etc., it auto searches the questions on Brainly.com. If an answer is found it will automatically answer the question and move on to the next. The script comes with a Brainly Lockpick, which removes the brainly paywall and 1 answer per day limit, allowing users to view all brainly answers for free. The bot can be left to run on it's own, but it's recommended that you stay in the same room in case the bot has any issues. If the bot does run into an issue, it can be fixed with a simple refresh of the page. This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. It requires an extension from the chrome webstore in order to run on Edgenuity.

A purchase key will be given to the user upon purchase of the script. The script costs $25 for one class and $5 dollars for every additional class. Payment can be sent via: Cashapp, Venmo, and Apple Pay/Apple Cash. 🔑

<h3>Key points:</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>The script comes with a Brainly Lockpick, which removes the brainly paywall and 1 answer per day limit, allowing users to view all brainly answers for free 🔐</li><br>
<li>It goes back to the course-line and continues doing non test tasks on it's own. 🧠</li><br>
<li>The bot can be left to run on it's own, but it's recommended that you stay in the same room in case the bot has any issues. 💁‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script can answer many types of assignments by itself. ✍</li><br>
<li>It may answer a question wrong once in a blue moon, but that's only on non essential (not graded) assignments. 😴</li><br>
<li>While the user is manually taking a test, quiz, cumulative exam, etc.., it will automatically find the answer for the question on brainly, answer it, and move on to the next question if an answer is found. If not it will wait for the user to move on to the next question.  🔴🟢</li><br>
<li>Answers questions correctly 90% of the time. 🎯</li><br>
<li>Make sure to check for updates daily, either here on github or on the site <a href="https://edgenuity-plus.web.app/">EdgePlus➕</a></li><br>
<li>Sharing purchase keys might lead to technical difficulties on both parties ends. Please refrain from doing so. 🛑</li><br>
<li>This is still a work in progress, it's good and functional but it may still need some work. If you have any issues please contact me asap. 🙏</li><br>

<h3>Reasons for script obfuscation: </h3>
<ol style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>If the script wasn't obfuscated, Edgenuity will easily be able to patch it due to the script utilizing an exploit found within their answer() function. 🙂</li><br>
<li>The script has a built in purchase verification system. If the script wasn't obfuscated people will easily be able to take credit for my work by removing the purchase verification functions and selling it as their own. 🥴</li><br>
</ol>
<h3>Common Problems: </h3>
<ul>
<li>You must allow popups if you want EdgyBot to automatically open brainly answers and return back to the page to auto answer (if an answer was found). ⚙</i><br>
<li>If the bot freezes on a question, a simple refresh of the page fixes it immediatly. 🔄</li><br>
<li>This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. 🤷‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script won't work on a school computer ( unless TamperMonkey installation is allowed on chrome web store ). 👎</li><br>
</ul>
