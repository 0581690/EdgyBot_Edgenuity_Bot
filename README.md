<h3>Patch & Unpatch Details</h3>
<p>This is a major update due to the script getting patched by Edgenuity on 9/27/22 late at night. We released an unpatched version mere hours after we were alerted of the patch. All users were sent an Email / Direct Message / SMS with instructions on how to update to the unpatched version. We started receiving bug reports late at night on 9/27/22 and took down the site so no orders would continue to come through. We were expecting this but didn't think Edgenuity would really go through with it ( given their track record ), so we knew exactly what to fix and had another answer function ready for deployment. 🎉🎉</p>
<br>
<h3>Description:</h3>
EdgyBot: A partially AFK Edgenuity Bot brought to you by EdgePlus+. Works on 99% of assignments offered by Edgenuity. It does all non graded assignments on the user's course-line first (By itself) and leaves the graded work for the user which it unlocks brainly for and does auto brainly searches. The script comes with a Brainly Lockpick, which removes the brainly paywall and 1 answer per day limit, allowing users to view all brainly answers for free, ( You can use this for other things not just Edgenuity ). The bot can be left to run on it's own, but it's recommended that you stay in the same room in case the bot has any issues. If the bot does run into an issue, it can be fixed with a simple refresh of the page. This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. It requires an extension from the chrome webstore in order to run on Edgenuity.

<h3>Key points:</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>When you leave the EdgyBot to do work by itself, you need to <b>stay on the same tab.</b> The bot will not work if you are on another tab. 🔴</li><br>
<li>Clicking <b>CTRL ALT B</b> on your computer keyboard let's you remove or add the classic EdgyBot wallpaper. 🌃</li><br>
<li>Clicking <b>CTRL ALT R</b> on your computer keyboard now resets your EdgyBot by removing the purchase key connected to the account along with saved classes and other settings. This is to fix any issues being faced on your end. If this doesn't fix the issue, contact sedgenuity@gmail.com.  🔴</li><br>
<li>Clicking <b>CTRL ALT C</b> on your computer keyboard let's you switch the class you set EdgyBot to do. 🔃</li><br>
<li>Quizzes, Tests, and any other heavily graded assignments will never be fully automated. We do not want our bot to mess up your grades in case it has a bug/issue, so for those sort of assignments, EdgyBot <b>only assists</b> but never does the work for you automatically, neither does it open them by itself. It requires a turn off of the bot via tampermonkey, opening the assignment, and turning back on of the bot in order for assistance. Your heavily graded assignments are completely safe. These assignments won't be automated in future updates unless we can guarantee a 90%+ on these assignments through automation. 🔒</li><br>
<li>When EdgyBot is doing work, it might look like it's going crazy but you have to trust it. Everything it does, it does for a reason. <b>Everything is Calculated</b> 🧠😵</li><br>
<li><b>Version 1.7 & Up</b> now automatically check for updates on the <a href="https://edgenuity-plus.web.app/">EdgePlus+</a> website, so users always have the latest personalized EdgyBot. 🤩 </li><br>
<li>EdgyBot will now ask you to pick a class for it to work on. When you want to switch a class click <b>CTRL ALT C</b> on your keyboard. 😉</li><br>
<li>The script comes with a Brainly Lockpick, which removes the brainly paywall and 1 answer per day limit, allowing users to view all brainly answers for free 🔐</li><br>
<li>It goes back to the course-line and continues doing non test tasks on it's own. 🧠</li><br>
<li>The bot can be left to run on it's own, but it's recommended that you stay in the same room in case the bot has any issues. 💁‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script can answer many types of assignments by itself. ✍</li><br>
<li>It may answer a question wrong once in a blue moon, but that's only on non essential (not graded) assignments. 😴</li><br>
<li>While the user is manually taking a test, quiz, cumulative exam, etc.., it will automatically find the answer for the question on brainly, answer it, and move on to the next question if an answer is found. If not it will wait for the user to move on to the next question.  🔴🟢</li><br>
<li>Answers questions correctly 90% of the time. 🎯</li><br>
<li>Make sure to check for updates daily, either here on github or on the site <a href="https://edgenuity-plus.web.app/">EdgePlus➕</a></li><br>
<li>Sharing purchase keys might lead to technical difficulties on both persons ends. Please refrain from doing so. 🛑</li><br>
<li>This is still a work in progress, it's good and functional but it may still need some work. If you have any issues please contact me asap. 🙏</li><br>
<li>Once again, You can not hold me liable for your actions. This tool is for educational purposes only. You have been warned ‼ ⚠ </li><br>
</ul>
<h3>Reasons for script obfuscation: </h3>
<ol style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>If the script wasn't obfuscated, Edgenuity will easily be able to patch it due to the script utilizing an exploit found within their answer() function. <br/><br/><b>Note:</b> They did that and patched our script, sooo we unpatched it 🥳🥳</li><br>
<li>The script has a built in purchase verification system. If the script wasn't obfuscated people will easily be able to take credit for my work by removing the purchase verification functions and selling it as their own. 🥴</li><br>
</ol>
<h3>Common Problems: </h3>
<ul>
<li>You must allow popups if you want EdgyBot to automatically open brainly answers and return back to the page to auto answer (if an answer was found). </li><br>
<li>If the bot freezes on a question, a simple refresh of the page fixes it immediatly. 🔄</li><br>
<li>This script has only been tested on chrome, so for the time being, should only be used on chrome. 🤷‍♂️</li><br>
<li>The script won't work on a school computer  (unless TamperMonkey installation is allowed on chrome web store). 👎</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>Tips & Tricks: </h3>
<ul>
<li>To fix pretty much any bug, click <b>CTRL ALT R</b> and factory reset. Re-enter your purchase key and the problem should be gone. 👌</li><br>
<li>To take tests that the bot has skipped, turn off the script via tampermonkey, open the test/quiz and turn the bot back on. It will continue assiting u 👌</li><br>
<li>You can leave it on at night and it will have a lot of work done by the time you wake up 😴</li><br>
<li>If you have any issues that you would like resolved quickly, it's recommended you contact me via instagram. 🙂</li><br>
<li>If you want to do something else while the bot is running, open a new window not a new tab. 👍</li><br>
</ul>

<h3>Bug Reports & Statuses: ( 11 )</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bug found by treloots: Issue with purchase verification due to symbols being in the user's name. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by treloots: Static url issue which prevented the bot from opening classes on it's own and resulted in edgenuity throwing (503) errors, essentialy taking away the bots AFK capabilities making it useless. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: AFK task selection bug that would stop EdgyBot. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: Class Picking feature implemented in v1.5 caused AFK to stop functioning. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: Auto Update feature implemented in v1.7 caused AFK to stop functioning. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Ahmad: Bug affecting some users due to different placement of window.frames[index].API & FrameChain() leading to EdgyBot completely malfunctioning [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Ricky: Bug affecting vocabulary assignments leading the bot to lose AFK & traps it in a location.reload() loop [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Michael & GSRHackZ: Assignments are no longer fully afk. The assignments here are the graded assignments with multiple choices questions, text box inputs and no videos. Anything with videos is still AFK, while the ones with only questions are not AFK but instead correct answers will be highlighted in blue by the bot. This is a fix for now until I have time to actually work on an AFK fix for assignments. [FIXED & CHANGED] 🕷🚩</li><br>
<li>Bug found by Ahmad & GSRHackZ: Bug affecting video watcher, leading to video loop causing EdgyBot to lose AFK until refresh. [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by GSRHackZ: Vocabulary assignment auto loop after completion bug which would make EdgyBot lose AFK until user manually exits [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
<li>Bug found by bigmanpranks: server & purchase key creation issues on the edgePlus website [FIXED] 🕷</li><br>
